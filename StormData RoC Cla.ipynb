         "Iowa enjoyed a welcomed period of dry weather from February 21 through March 5.   Unfortunately, temperatures remained too low to allow substantial melting of the considerable Iowa snowpack during this dry spell.   Rain, mostly in the light to moderate category, was frequent and widespread from the 6th through the 13th.   The rain was accompanied by much warmer temperatures and resulted in rapid snowmelt.   Snow cover, which ranged from 1 to 7 inches along the Missouri border to as much as 30 inches in northwest Iowa at the beginning of the month, was gone by March 17 (with the exception of some drifts).   The combination of snow melt and rainfall pushed nearly all Iowa rivers above flood stage with major flooding reported at some northern Iowa locations.   Despite much drier weather during the second one-half of March, flooding continued at month���s end along the Des Moines River, the Mississippi River below Muscatine and over parts of northwest Iowa.    Rainfall amounts for the month were generally above normal over southern Iowa and well below normal over the northeast.   Rain totals varied from 0.58 inches at Waukon to 4.09 inches at Beaconsfield.   There was only one snow event of consequence during the month.   Snow fell over all but far northern Iowa on the 19th-20th with greatest amounts in the south where 6 or more inches fell at Murray, Lacona, Indianola, Newton, and Des Moines.   The statewide average snowfall was 2.0 inches for the month, or 2.8 inches less than normal.   This ranks as the 23rd lowest March total among 123 years of record.   However, the meager March snowfall was enough to push the statewide average seasonal snowfall total to 47.7 inches or seventh highest of record (greatest total since 1978-1979 winter).  With the month starting out with an extensive snow and water content in the snow pack of 2 to as much as 10 inches, flooding was a virtual certainty across the CWA.  Due to the slow melt, most rivers crested on the high end of moderate intensity, with a few reaching major flood stage.  Initially, ice jamming was a significant problem.  Some of the worst occurred on the Raccoon west of Des Moines, resulting in flash flooding.  Flash flooding also occurred in the the Fort Dodge area with considerable flooding in the town of Fort Dodge.  Scattered ice jams also occurred in north central and northwest Iowa in the Mason City and Estherville areas.  Much of the flooding was to agricultural lands for much of the period, however cities along the rivers were inundated by the flood waters.  It was fortunate that heavy rainfall did not occur during the melting process.  Much of Iowa avoided what could have been a major disaster.",

         "The upper level trough which was across the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle on the 23rd of October began to eject into north central Texas and southern Oklahoma on the 24th.  This trough was accompanied by strong winds aloft and in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  During the afternoon...the low level winds were unidirectional ahead of a dryline which surged into north central Texas and eastern Oklahoma.

         "October 2010 continued the trend of warmer and drier than normal weather|that has prevailed since July. Many locations received less than 2 inches of rainfall. Drought conditions and fire activity worsened during the month. Monthly precipitiation totals ranged from less than 0.50 inches in portions of central Indiana to 3.50 inches near Lake Michigan in northwest Indiana. This was 10% of normal in portions of central Indiana to 125% of normal in portions of northwest and east central Indiana. Nearly one-half of the state received less than an inch of rain during October.||Drought conditions gradually deteriorated during October. The National Drought Monitor for October 5 indicated nearly 50% of the Indiana with moderate (D1) to severe (D2) drought conditions. By the end of October, moderate (D1) to extreme (D3) drought conditions had spread to nearly all of the state. The National Drought Monitor for November 2nd indicated that virtually all of Indiana south of U.S. Highway 36 was in severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought. Extreme (D3) drought conditions prevailed in much of south central Indiana. Here are some of the impacts of the drought.||Here are some of the agricultural impacts this month. The Indiana Weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report released on November 1st indicated that 98% of the corn and soybean acreage had been harvested (record harvest pace). Soils remained very dry with 93% of the top soil and sub soil moisture rated short to very short. Only 3% of the pastures statewide were rated good. Thirty percent of the winter wheat was rated poor to very poor. Farmers were concerned about possible hay shortages during the winter because of poor pasture conditions. Farmers in several areas of southern Indiana continued to haul water to livestock because local springs and streams had gone dry.||Here are some of the water utilities impacts. Southern Indiana's persistent dry spell prompted state officials to ask companies and others in the area that use large volumes of water to voluntarily reduce usage by 10 to 15 percent. Indiana Department of Environmental Management reported a few limited water supply problems in southern Indiana that affected one local business and a small water utility. The agency also reported water levels in wells, lakes and streams lower than normal in southern Indiana.||Here are some of the impacts associated with fires and fire concerns throughout the month. The drought conditions led to numerous field fires Indiana. Large field fires were noted on the 9th, 10th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd and 27th. These fires coincided with warm temperatures, low relative humidity values and moderate to strong winds. Indiana Forestry indicated high fire danger for much of south central Indiana including the counties of Owen, Greene, Martin, Lawrence, Brown, Monroe, Johnson, Morgan, Jackson, Bartholomew, Jennings, Orange, Washington, Scott, Clark, Crawford, Harrison and Perry. Conditions for problematic fires existed in roughly three-quarters of the state. During the first 3 weeks of October, fire activity was well above normal and was comparable to the fire season of 1999 and at times the record fire season of 1988. Fire activity transitioned from field fires in central Indiana to timber fires in southern Indiana during the last week of October. Timber fires were the worst since the record fire season of 1988. At one point in October, burning bans existed for more than 75% of Indiana���s counties. With the arrival of cooler temperatures and some rainfall near the end of the month, burning bans existed in only 55% of the Indiana counties at the beginning of November.||Here are some of the hydrologic impacts for the month. During October, stream flow continued to slowly diminish. At the end of October, U.S. Geological Survey gauging sites indicated several small watersheds at or near daily record low flow in Indiana. Consequently, the flow in the White, East Fork White and Wabash Rivers was below normal. The lowest river flow, when compared to normal, was in southwest Indiana. In central Indiana, all Indianapolis water supply reservoirs and Monroe Lake ranged from 2 to 4.5 feet below normal lake levels.",
         "On October 19th, the U.S. Drought Monitor placed southern portions of Hancock County under a Severe (D2) Drought designation.  A countywide burn ban was also in effect.  This lasted through the end of the month of October.",

         "October 2010 continued the trend of warmer and drier than normal weather|that has prevailed since July. Many locations received less than 2 inches of rainfall. Drought conditions and fire activity worsened during the month. Monthly precipitiation totals ranged from less than 0.50 inches in portions of central Indiana to 3.50 inches near Lake Michigan in northwest Indiana. This was 10% of normal in portions of central Indiana to 125% of normal in portions of northwest and east central Indiana. Nearly one-half of the state received less than an inch of rain during October.||Drought conditions gradually deteriorated during October. The National Drought Monitor for October 5 indicated nearly 50% of the Indiana with moderate (D1) to severe (D2) drought conditions. By the end of October, moderate (D1) to extreme (D3) drought conditions had spread to nearly all of the state. The National Drought Monitor for November 2nd indicated that virtually all of Indiana south of U.S. Highway 36 was in severe (D2) to extreme (D3) drought. Extreme (D3) drought conditions prevailed in much of south central Indiana. Here are some of the impacts of the drought.||Here are some of the agricultural impacts this month. The Indiana Weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report released on November 1st indicated that 98% of the corn and soybean acreage had been harvested (record harvest pace). Soils remained very dry with 93% of the top soil and sub soil moisture rated short to very short. Only 3% of the pastures statewide were rated good. Thirty percent of the winter wheat was rated poor to very poor. Farmers were concerned about possible hay shortages during the winter because of poor pasture conditions. Farmers in several areas of southern Indiana continued to haul water to livestock because local springs and streams had gone dry.||Here are some of the water utilities impacts. Southern Indiana's persistent dry spell prompted state officials to ask companies and others in the area that use large volumes of water to voluntarily reduce usage by 10 to 15 percent. Indiana Department of Environmental Management reported a few limited water supply problems in southern Indiana that affected one local business and a small water utility. The agency also reported water levels in wells, lakes and streams lower than normal in southern Indiana.||Here are some of the impacts associated with fires and fire concerns throughout the month. The drought conditions led to numerous field fires Indiana. Large field fires were noted on the 9th, 10th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd and 27th. These fires coincided with warm temperatures, low relative humidity values and moderate to strong winds. Indiana Forestry indicated high fire danger for much of south central Indiana including the counties of Owen, Greene, Martin, Lawrence, Brown, Monroe, Johnson, Morgan, Jackson, Bartholomew, Jennings, Orange, Washington, Scott, Clark, Crawford, Harrison and Perry. Conditions for problematic fires existed in roughly three-quarters of the state. During the first 3 weeks of October, fire activity was well above normal and was comparable to the fire season of 1999 and at times the record fire season of 1988. Fire activity transitioned from field fires in central Indiana to timber fires in southern Indiana during the last week of October. Timber fires were the worst since the record fire season of 1988. At one point in October, burning bans existed for more than 75% of Indiana���s counties. With the arrival of cooler temperatures and some rainfall near the end of the month, burning bans existed in only 55% of the Indiana counties at the beginning of November.||Here are some of the hydrologic impacts for the month. During October, stream flow continued to slowly diminish. At the end of October, U.S. Geological Survey gauging sites indicated several small watersheds at or near daily record low flow in Indiana. Consequently, the flow in the White, East Fork White and Wabash Rivers was below normal. The lowest river flow, when compared to normal, was in southwest Indiana. In central Indiana, all Indianapolis water supply reservoirs and Monroe Lake ranged from 2 to 4.5 feet below normal lake levels.",
         "On October 12th, the U.S. Drought Monitor placed a portion of southeastern Owen County under a Severe (D2) Drought designation.  Then it was expanded to cover most of Owen County a week later.  A countywide burn ban was also in effect.  This lasted through the end of the month of October.",

On January 25th, an upper level storm moved southeast across Oklahoma and the northeast Red River counties of North Texas, dropping up to an inch of sleet and snow at Paris. A second and stronger upper level storm moved across North Texas on the 26th and 27th, spreading a mixture of rain, freezing rain, sleet, and snow over all of North Texas. Ice accumulations ranged from a trace in the southern tier of counties to one quarter inch across the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Sleet and snow accumulations ranged from two inches in the Northwest to five inches in the Northeast. At least four deaths were blamed on icy driving conditions with hundreds of accidents on snow and ice covered roads. Numerous minor injuries occured. Numerous schools and business were closed at various time periods due to the ice and snow. Over four hundred flights were cancelled at the D/FW Airport and there were power outages to over 30,000 homes.",

In Montgomery County, a tree was downed onto a home in Kensington and 1000 customers lost power.  A wind gust of 42 MPH was recorded in Forest Glen and a wind gust of 53 MPH was recorded in Silver Spring and Glenmont.  In Prince Georges County, an awning blew off a restaurant an injured a 42-year-old woman in Greenbelt.  Several trees and power lines were downed across the county, resulting in 10,000 power outages.  Winds gusted to 53 MPH at Andrews Air Force Base and 48 MPH in South Bowie.  In Charles County, a wind gust of 65 MPH was recorded at Bryans Road.  In Calvert County, a few trees were downed.  In Anne Arundel County, winds gusted to 50 MPH in Annapolis, 48 MPH at Baltimore/Washington International Airport and Rivera Beach, and 47 MPH at Millersville.  Trees and power lines were downed in Arnold, Annapolis, and Glen Burnie, and 2000 customers lost power.  Other notable wind gusts across Maryland included 57 MPH at Westminster in Carroll County and Oraville in St. Mary's County, 54 MPH at Morganza in St. Mary's County, 53 MPH at Hagerstown in Washington County, and 51MPH at Laurel in Howard County.  In addition, blowout tides were reported on the west side of the Chesapeake Bay due to the length of time gusty northwest winds were observed.  Baltimore Harbor reported water levels 3 feet below normal by the morning of the 14th.",

         "A series of short waves in the upper air pattern produced periods of mostly light to occasionally moderate precipitation over the north half of Georgia from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon. Patchy light snow began in west central and northwest Georgia around daybreak on the 28th. There was a light dusting on the ground by mid morning from Troup to Carroll county, east to Fayette county. Due to the dry layer of air aloft, much of the precipitation evaporated before reaching the ground, so eastward progression of the area of snow was slow. By evening, a mixture of light snow, sleet and freezing rain became more widespread over west central and northwest Georgia. Although the precipitation remained light and temperatures hovered in the low to mid 30s, ice began to accumulate on roads, bridges and overpasses. There was a 47 car pile-up on I-20 in downtown Atlanta late Friday night that backed up traffic into early Saturday morning.  By Saturday morning, the 29th, temperatures had slowly fallen to near or just below the freezing mark over the north half of Georgia with a mix of light freezing drizzle, freezing rain, and sleet, with light snow in the mountains. The last batch of significant precipitation moved from Alabama into west central Georgia and on into the Atlanta metro area on Sunday morning. There were even one or two claps of thunder in Spalding county. Overall, the event generally produced 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice accumulation, with isolated areas getting 1/2 to 1 inch of ice. The main problems seemed to be traffic accidents due to icy roads and bridges. There were scattered areas of trees and power lines down, but damage from this storm was nowhere as much as that from the storm the previous weekend.",
