# Deforestation-and-Flooding-in-GA [In Progress]

## Overview of the Project 

This repository contains the data and preliminary analysis code of Georgia's deforestation and flooding conditions. The purpose of these analyses is to help construct a capstone project for Emory University's 
QTM498R Capstone project starting Spring 2025. The project is planned to explore the connection between deforestation and flooding events. Other factors and events may be integrated into the analysis next year.

## Potential Objectives

•	Analyze historical deforestation patterns 

•	Evaluate flooding frequency and severity trends

•	Identify correlations between various environmental factors

•	Develop policy recommendations

•	Predict future flood frequency using machine learning


## Key Research Questions

•	How have forest coverage patterns changed in Greater Atlanta? 

•	What is the relationship between deforestation and flooding frequency? 

•	How do land use changes impact water quality in the region? 

•	Which areas are most vulnerable to flooding?  

•	What roles do industrial forests versus old-growth forests play?

•	How effective have existing environmental policies been? 

## Deliverables

•	Interactive maps showing changes over time 

•	Statistical analysis report 

•	Policy recommendation document

## Track of Intermediate progress

•	`EPA and FEMA flood visualization` can be served as a template for making visualizations in python using shapefile of GA counties

•	`Chatham County Record` can be served as a template for making change of land cover overtime using MRLC data
